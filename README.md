# Note-Taking
Note taking (or notetaking) is the practice of writing down pieces of information in a systematic way.

DSchneider has the impression that Note taking includes the following:

Taking notes in a lecture or a discussion
Taking notes in a lecture + processing/annotating/rewriting these notes
Taking notes from reading / on the Web in some systematic way.
